Finding seats at the library
==============================

.. note:: `Ren Wen Library`_ ``人文社科图书馆`` is closed for renovations until the beginning of October, 2017.

Trying to find a place to study in the library can be tough around midterms and finals. In order to make sure that all desks are actually being used (i.e. people aren't just parking their stuff there all day), `Ren Wen Library`_ ``人文社科图书馆`` uses a check-in system, which, unfortunately, is only in Chinese. Luckily, it's not too hard to use if you know the basic logic.

Two check-in kiosks are around the main desk in the library on level G. There are more kiosks around the staircase on F2, F3, and F4.

.. note:: The kiosks on level G can be used to check in or out of any desk. Machines on the upper levels (F2, F3, and F4) can only be used to check in/out for seats on a given level.
