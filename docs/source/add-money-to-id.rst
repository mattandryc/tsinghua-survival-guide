Add money to your Student ID
=============================

There are terminals located at almost every dining hall on campus as well as at the North end of ``C楼``. In order to add money to your Student ID, you need to have a Bank of China account connected to your card. The branch_ at ``C楼`` can help you set one up (be sure to bring your **Passport** and **Student ID**).

1. Place your Student ID on the card reader

If your passport number is less than six digits, add zeros to the front to pad it to six digits (e.g. "123" becomes "000123").

4. Tap ``圈存`` (third icon from the top on the left menu)
