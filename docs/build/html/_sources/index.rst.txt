Tsinghua Survival Guide
========================


About
-----
Sometimes Tsinghua’s English documentation is hard to find |sad|. This site contains some useful stuff I’ve found. While it's helpful if you know Chinese, these articles don't require any prior knowledge of the language and are designed to be used 'as-is'.

If you'd like to request a topic for an article, email dusc16@mails.edu.cn.
