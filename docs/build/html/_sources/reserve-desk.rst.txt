Find seat at the library
=========================

Trying to find a place to study in the library can be tough around midterms and finals. In order to make sure that all desks are actually being used (i.e. people aren't just parking their stuff there all day), `Ren Wen Library`_ ``人文社科图书馆`` uses a check-in system, which, unfortunately, is only in Chinese. Luckily, it's not too hard to use if you know the basic logic.

Two check-in machines are around the main desk in the library on level G. There are more machines around the staircase on F2, F3, and F4.

.. note:: The machines on level G can be used to check in or out of any desk. Machines on the upper levels (F2, F3, and F4) can only be used to check in/out for seats on a given level.
